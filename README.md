# Today I Learned

A bit late to the TIL party, but wanted to start this as a good way to save snippets as I learn them. I love learning in public and only wish I had picked up this habit earlier.

It's also a better way to do gists in my opinion as gists just "get out of the flow" in my opinion.

For now, I'll leave things as single files, but eventually I'll organize in folders as I collect more. And that's when I'll add a table of contents as well.
